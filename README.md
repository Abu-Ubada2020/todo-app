## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Learned about Local Storage and it's useful while doing this project.
- Loved implementing themes in the app, especially based on the OS preference and saving the user or OS preference in Local Storage for future use.
- Implementing Drag and Drop feature made me learn new things.

### Continued development

i wanna focus more on learning react getting comfortable with managing state, and using hooks that react has to offer. definitely making drag and drop feature more accessible to users.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - this site has definitely helped to get my knowledge up and running.
- [ReactJS(beta)](https://beta.reactjs.org/) - learning about hooks has definitely been easier learning from here.
